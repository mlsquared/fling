# Blade RF Hello World

I have started working with the bladeRF, particularly working on the signal detection process, and have developed a 'live reader' that uses signals from the antenna connected on the bladeRF to read and output signal strength values in real time.

In the process of development, I am being lead in thought to consider these two items as a sort of "next step".
- Eliminating/Reducing Noise
- Figuring out triangulation process

My next focus will be on coming up with potential ideas to reduce noise, as well as how to start the triangulation process (incorporating multiple sensors.)
