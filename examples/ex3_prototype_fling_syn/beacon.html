    <title>Sandboxed Inititator Beacon based on embedding session ID in port numbers</title>
</head>
<body>

  <p>
    I assume that this web page would be loaded from a web page 
    that desires to communicate with a node in the same network.
    Or we could provide embed code that someone can cut-and-paste
    into a web page to "fling-enable it."  This code is ONLY a
    sandboxed initiator beacon that uses TCP SYNs.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    This page encodes the session ID as a set of 3 port numbers.  If
    we used only 1 port number, we would only be able to generate
    2**16-1024 unique session IDs.  The reduction by 1024 takes into
    account the well known port numbers from 0 to 1023 inclusive,
    which would likely be blocked by some if not all major browsers.
    If we use 3 port numbers with replacement then we could generate
    (2**16-1024)**3 distinct triplets.  However, to ensure that order
    is retained we would need to pause between each fetch, and there
    is still a possibility that the port numbers would be reordered.
    Furthermore, if we want to send a port number more than once to
    make it easier for the unsandboxed beacon detector (a.k.a., beacon
    detector) to read the number then we should send three distinct
    unique numbers and do it in a manner where order does not matter,
    e.g., we could sort the numbers from smallest to largest to create
    the session ID.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, we could choose 3 16-bit values greater than 1023.
    If I understand correctly this would be the same as
    math.comb(2**16-1024, 3) possible session IDs which results in
    math.log(math.comb(2**16-1024, 3),2) possible session IDs
    expressed as a power of 2, i.e., the number of bits of session ID
    is approximately 45.3.  This is a little shy of the number of bits
    in Ethernet addresses, and would probably be large
    enough to avoid almost all collisions between two mobile devices
    trying to beacon at the same time.
