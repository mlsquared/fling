Use jupyter notebooks or colab notebooks to writeup 
experiments.  Commit the results along with a clear
explanation of the experiment setup, how data sets
were generated or collected, and what metrics
were being used to judge performance.

You can store small data with your labs using git-lfs in your 
lab directory.  If you share data across labs it is okay to 
cross-reference to the lab that contains data generation. 
Or we can create a separate datasets directory inside the repo, 
but always using git-lfs and only for smallish datasets.

Do not place data larger than 100 MB into git-lfs.
Put large data on the drives in Hong's GPU cluster.
We can hang more drives off of that and use one for backup.
