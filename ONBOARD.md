# Onboarding

1. Get an account on github if you don't already have one.

2. Email me at `harrison@cs.olemiss.edu` with the name of the account
and I will add you to the Machine Learning Media Lab 
  `https://github.com/mlsquared`

3. Get an account with Google Colab.

4. To work locally use Jupyter notebooks. 

  - install jupyter notebooks in your local environment.


We will be using Python and depending on what other parts of project
you do, you may have to learn web frameworks.
