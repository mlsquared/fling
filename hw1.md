# Homework 1: Networking and Basic Security

## Part 1: Networking Concepts

This project involves signal processing, networking, web technologies, 
and machine learning.   This homework focuses on Internet technologies.

On separate paper or in a file, write the answer to each of these questions.

1.1. What is a packet header?  Describe each field and its function.


1.2. What do TCP and IP stand for?  (Looking for the words composing the
achronym.  Subsequent questions will ask for more detail)


1.3. Describe the function of each of the layers in the TCP/IP networking
stack:  Link Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, Application Layer.

1.4. The OSI model breaks this into 7 layers which are useful conceptually, 
but the they do not directly associate with the design of the Internet.
Contrast and compare the TCP/IP model with the OSI 7-layer model.
 
1.5. What are some differences between an Ethernet frame header and an
IP header?

1.6. Why do we use both Ethernet addresses and IP addresses?

1.7. What is a Internet router?  What are some key differences between a 
router and a switch?

1.8. In the TCP/IP model, what layer is TCP?

1.9. In the TCP/IP model, what layer is HTTP?

1.10. Explain how data encapsulation works in the TCP/IP model.

1.11. Explain the difference between IPv4 and IPv6. Why was IPv6 introduced?

1.12. What is NAT (Network Address Translation) and why is it used?

1.13. What is IPv4 address exhaustion?

1.14. Describe what happens during the process of a TCP three-way handshake.

1.15. What are the differences between TCP and UDP? Give examples of 
applications that use each protocol.


# Part 2: Domain Name System

2.1. What is the purpose of DNS (Domain Name System) and how does it work?

2.2. Explain how the DNS resolution process works, starting from when a user types a URL into their browser.


2.3. What are the different types of DNS records, and what does each type do (e.g., A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT)?

2.4. What is the difference between a recursive DNS resolver and an authoritative DNS server?

2.5. Describe what happens during a DNS query and response process.

2.6 What is a DNS zone, and how does it relate to DNS records?

2.7. What is DNS caching, and how does it improve performance?

2.8. What is TTL in the context of DNS responses?

2.9. Use `dig` or `nslookup` to find the A record for olemiss.edu.  What 
is/are the IP address(es)?

2.10. Use `dig` or `nslookup' to find the NS record for the root name servers.

2.11 Usea 'dig' or 'nslookup' to find the NS records for the cs.olemiss.edu
name servers? 

2.12. Explain the role of the root DNS servers in the DNS hierarchy.

2.13. What is a reverse DNS lookup and how is it different from a forward DNS lookup?


# Part 3: Security

3.1. What is HTTPS and how is it different from HTTP?

3.2. Explain the role of SSL/TLS in HTTPS.

3.3. What are digital certificates, and how do they contribute to secure communications?

3.4. Describe the concept of public-key cryptography and how it is used in secure communications.

3.5. What is a Certificate Authority (CA) and what role does it play in web security?

3.6. Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

3.7. What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and how does it enhance security?

3.8. What is a firewall, and how does it protect a network?
